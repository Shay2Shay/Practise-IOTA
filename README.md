# Practise-IOTA

Hello UG-1 (Batch of 2025) and UG-2 (Batch of 2024).
This is a Practise repository(repo, in short) to teach you the basics of Git and GitHub, and understanding what is Flow Control.

## Don't forget to practise atleast once after the session. 

## **I will keep this Repo open for you to make sample Pull Requests(PRs), even after the session.**

## Try making a PR with 2 files.

### file1 = YourName.txt 
  containing your name & roll number.
### file2 = YourRollno.c
  A simple C program the prints your name. (Just like a HelloWorld code.)
# Cheers !
